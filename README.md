# leaflet-challenge
# Create Earthquake visualization using Leaflet to create a map that plots all earthquakes from the USGS dataset
# based on their longitude and latitude
# Data markers reflects the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and depth by color
# The larger the circle, the higher the magnitude
# The darker the color, the greater the depth of the earthquake
# Popups provide more information about the earthquake when the associated marker is clicked
# Legend provides more context to the map data
